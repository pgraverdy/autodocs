## Tips and tricks

- To have a hierarchy in the code's documentation
    - in the root's index.rst (in doc) load thr root's api/index.rst
    - in this index.rst, put the API title with 3 = below
    - in this file, load all files with glob (load in alphabetic order) 
    - in each sub rst filem have the title (CPP and Python) with the same numer of = as letters 
        - in the example_google.py
